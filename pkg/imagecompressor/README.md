## imagecompressor

A Go library for image compression using a client interface.
The library abstracts the underlying image compressor service and provides a simple way to upload and retrieve the compressed file.

Here are some clients we have for some Compressor Services:

* [Kraken](kraken)
* [reSmush](resmush)
* [Tinify](tinify)
